This is a productivity tool to maximize the density of my life based on the foundational theories of Chained Time-Delay Protocol (CTDP) and Recursive Stabilization Iteration Protocol (RSIP) developed by "Harry Kane".

## What is CTDP?

CTDP (Chained Time-Delay Protocol) is a behavioral contract framework built upon three core principles: the Sacred Seat Principle, the Mandatory Clause Principle, and the Linear Time-Delay Principle (All could be renamed with better translation). Specifically, it requires you to construct two parallel task chains (the Main Chain and the Auxiliary Chain) and to strictly follow the steps below:

### Main Chain:
1. First, designate a specific event or object as your marker — this is your “Sacred Seat.”
(In reality, a Sacred Seat is merely a symbolic anchor — it can be anything: a specific chair, a particular pen, a hat, or even a message you send to yourself on WeChat.)

2. Once you trigger this marker, you must perform a clearly defined focus task in your best possible state.

3. Every time you successfully complete a focus session, record one node in the chain — the first success is #1, the second #2, the third #3, and so on.

4. If at any point during a task you fail to perform in your “best state,” you must choose one of the two options below — the Mandatory Clause Principle:

(1) Declare the entire chain invalid, clear all accumulated nodes, and next time restart only from node #1.

(2) Permit the current imperfect action to stand, but from now on, this behavior must be permanently allowed in all future tasks and can no longer be ignored or denied.

### Sacred Seat Principle
Imagine a classroom full of seats, and you can sit on any of them. One day, you decide to designate one of them as the "Sacred Seat", and make the following rule for yourself:
When you are sitting on any other seat, you can do whatever you like – but once you sit on the Sacred Seat, you must be in your best behavior, fully focused, and study for 1 hour straight. If you don't have the confidence to do so, simply sit elsewhere. In short, this Sacred Seat shall never be tarnished by any unfocused bodies.



### Auxiliary Chain:
1. 
2. 
3. 

$I = \int_{0}^{\infty} V(\tau) \cdot W(\tau)d\tau$
