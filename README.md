This is a productivity tool to maximize the density of my life based on the foundational theories of Chained Time-Delay Protocol (CTDP) and Recursive Stabilization Iteration Protocol (RSIP) developed by "Harry Kane".

## What is CTDP?

CTDP (Chained Time-Delay Protocol) is a behavioral contract framework built upon three core principles: the Sacred Seat Principle, the Mandatory Clause Principle, and the Linear Time-Delay Principle (All could be renamed with better translation). Specifically, it requires you to construct two parallel task chains (the Main Chain and the Auxiliary Chain) and to strictly follow the steps below:

### Main Chain:
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Auxiliary Chain:
1. 
2. 
3. 

$I = \int_{0}^{\infty} V(\tau) \cdot W(\tau)d\tau$
